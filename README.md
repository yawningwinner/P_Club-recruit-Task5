I created the neural network using numpy library.
### Method :
Each image is a numpy array of shape (32,32,3). First converted it into greyscale image using Pillow and its Image function and reshaped the numpy array to shape (1024,1).
Then converted this into a Dataframe and inserted it into the Neural Network with learning rate = 0.01, 4 hidden layers of 128 neurons each.
Used ReLU and softmax for optimization.
